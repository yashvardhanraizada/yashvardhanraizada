## Hi there! 👋

I'm Yash Vardhan Raizada, a Software Engineer at Microsoft Teams, focusing on the exciting world of Generative AI and the Copilot domain. I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and creating innovative solutions. I'm an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. 

On weekends, I go and teach English to primary school students in Bengaluru who just study Kannada, their mother tongue and later face difficulty in English communication. I am also a part-time mentor at Scaler School of Technology.

## About Me :)

- 👨‍💻 I enjoy tackling complex problems that go beyond just software development. I'm fascinated by how software can help solve real-world challenges, whether it involves tinkering with hardware, data analysis, machine learning, or building AI models.

- 📚 I'm a bookworm and an avid reader. You'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book, exploring new ideas, and expanding my knowledge.

- ☕ Coffee is my constant companion. It's a source of energy and inspiration during those long coding sessions and brainstorming moments.

- 🏋️‍♂️ I'm all about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Squash, swimming, and yoga are my trusted fitness buddies, helping me stay in shape and maintain a balanced work-life routine.

- 💡 I thrive in the creative and competitive atmosphere of hackathons. Building innovative solutions under pressure is not just a challenge but also a source of immense satisfaction.
